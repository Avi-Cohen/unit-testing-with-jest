Two years ago I used to work in Allegiant Air and a major part of my my job was to write unit tests in JAVA using JUnit5.
The purpose of this project is to be my first comeback to unit testing. This time using  Jest, and hopefully I will get to a point where my knowledge in jest is almost at the same level I acheived in JUnit5.
